    <p>Welcome to the personal website of Samuel Yniesta. I am an Assistant Professor at  Polytechnique Montréal (Montréal, Canada), in the Department of Civil, Geological and Mining Engineering. This website summarizes my research and teaching activities in the fields of Geotechnical and Earthquake Engineering.</p>
    <h4><u>About Me</u></h4>
    <p>I grew up in France in Saint-Etienne, a city known for its coal mine and its soccer team. I completed the first half of my bachelors degree in Lyon at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie Lyon 1  (IUT A Lyon 1) and then continued my studies in Paris at the Ecole Speciale des Travaux Publics (ESTP). While completing my bachelors degree, I studied Civil Engineering with a focus on Public Works. In 2012 I obtained a Master of Science at UCLA in Geotechnical Engineering, after which I immediately started my Ph.D. under the supervision of Scott Brandenberg.

        During my Ph.D. I worked on centrifuge tests of levees atop peaty organic soil, and on constitutive modeling of soils under dynamic loading. After completing my Ph.D. in March 2016, I immediately started my position at Polytechnique Montréal.</p>
